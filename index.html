        <p class="lead">A five dimensional political compass</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>Statecraft is, in essence, a political quiz that attempts to assign percentages for five different political axes. You will be presented by a question, and then you will answer with your opinion on the question. Each answer will slightly affect your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be compared to the maximum possible for each value, thus giving you a percentage. There is a total of 61 questions. Answer as though you are creating your ideal society, rather than reflecting on the society you live in now. Answer honestly!</p>
